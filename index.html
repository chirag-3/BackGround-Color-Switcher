    <p>Vegeta (ベジータ Bejīta), more specifically Vegeta IV (ベジータ四世 Bejīta Yonsei)[7], recognized as Prince Vegeta 
        (ベジータ王子 Bejīta Ōji) is the prince of the fallen Saiyan race and the husband of Bulma, the father of Trunks 
        and Bulla, the eldest son of King Vegeta, as well as one of the main characters of the Dragon Ball series.
        Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer,[8] but later abandons his role in the Frieza Force, instead opting to remain and live on Earth. He would later repeatedly fight alongside Universe 7's most powerful warriors in order to protect Earth and his family, as well as to surpass Goku in power.[9]

        Vegeta's character development is the most praised and one of the biggest in the series. He started off 
        serving as the main antagonist of the Saiyan Saga, but then as an anti-heroic tritagonist throughout the 
        rest of Dragon Ball Z. After the Majin Buu Saga, he would evolve into a hero as the main deuteragonist/
        secondary protagonist of the sequel series Dragon Ball Super.</p>
